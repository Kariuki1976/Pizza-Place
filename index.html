                <p>Americans eat approximately 100 acres of pizza each day, or 350 slices per second,<br>36% of all pizza orders want their pizza topped with pepperoni.<br> Your taste buds are the primary factor in what makes pizza special. Along with sweet,
                    salty, sour and bitter, there is a fifth "taste " called umami.<br>Umami was pinpointed by a Japanese chemist who took his observations into a lab and determined exactly what "umami " was and how it affected your taste buds.
                    <br>You'll be shocked to know that the carb-fest that is pizza actually fills you with serotonin<br>This is partially because when you're craving pizza and that craving is satisfied, your brain produces serotonin.<br>This is also because
                    carbs are used heavily to make serotonin. </p>
